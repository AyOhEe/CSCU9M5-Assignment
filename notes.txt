This .txt file contains the rough contents for each section, before I made the poster.
I prefer writing my thoughts in text, but writing them in a file lets me keep this in version control.

TODO [explain consequence]
 - Something about assuming that the main correlation to be found in position will be identifying
   particularly well-burning "hot spots" for wildfires, and as such one-hot encoding will make more
   sense than continuous as the correlation is assumed to not be linear w.r.t. X or Y, but a
   combination involving both coordinates.
 - That isn't really a consequence. Think of something else?


Section 4:
The "rain" variable has a large majority value at 0, comprising almost all datapoints.
As such, this variable was not considered.
