This .txt file contains the rough contents for each section, before I made the poster.
I prefer writing my thoughts in text, but writing them in a file lets me keep this in version control.

Section 2:
[TODO progressively outline]
Test/train/validate: 65/17.5/17.5
This was done to ensure sufficient test and validation data at the end of training, as
the dataset is rather small at only 517 entries.

Performed histogram analysis and removed "rain" variable.
Configured orange workflow to train and test the three selected model types on the train 
and test datasets, and to display results on both the test and validation datasets.

Section 3:
- X: Discrete Feature - Used
- Y: Discrete Feature - Used
- Month: Categorical Feature - Used
- Day: Categorical Feature - Unused
- FFMC: Continuous Feature - Used
- DMC: Continuous Feature - Used
- DC: Continuous Feature - Used
- ISI: Continuous Feature - Used
- Temp: Continuous Feature - Used
- RH: Continuous Feature - Used
- Wind: Continuous Feature - Used
- Rain: Continuous Feature - Unused (due to histogram)
- Area: Categorical Target - Required.
TODO [explain consequence]
 - Something about assuming that the main correlation to be found in position will be identifying
   particularly well-burning "hot spots" for wildfires, and as such one-hot encoding will make more
   sense than continuous as the correlation is assumed to not be linear w.r.t. X or Y, but a
   combination involving both coordinates.
 - That isn't really a consequence. Think of something else?


Section 4:
The "rain" variable has a large majority value at 0, comprising almost all datapoints.
As such, this variable was not considered.

Section 5:
Model types used: Neural Network, Random forest, Support Vector Machine
